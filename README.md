# Medical Image Classification

Model was build and optimized on colab.research.google.com
For better a better overview it was packed in subfiles 
and published on github.

The Version on github is not supposed to be a "run out of the box" solution.
It should be seen, as a suggestion on how to structure ML-Projects in an structured manner. I will also add the Python Notebook, so the interested reader can make themself a picture of why it is useful to structure the project in different Python files, rather than in one big Jupyter Notebook.
